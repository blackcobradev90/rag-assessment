        The Boya BY-M1 is an omnidirectional lavalier microphone primarily designed for capturing speech in video recordings. 
        Its omnidirectional pickup pattern captures sound from all directions, making it suitable for interviews, presentations, and general voice recording. 
        While it can record musical instruments, its design and frequency response are optimized for vocals rather than the dynamic range and nuances of musical instruments.
        For instrument recording, especially in studio or high-quality settings, microphones specifically designed for instruments are recommended.
        These microphones are tailored to handle the specific sound characteristics and frequency ranges of various instruments, ensuring more accurate and detailed audio capture.
